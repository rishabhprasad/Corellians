#### By Rishabh Prasad, Matthew Landry, Anupras Burokas

## Activity 2 

### Background
For this second Milestone, we will transfer our designs to lo-fi diagrams, note down the current sitemap, perform a content asset inventory for the current website, and propose new sitemaps.

### Customer
We would like to reiterate that our North Star customers would be IABC members.

### Sitemaps
We have noted down the current sitemap, which is both quite lengthy (number of pages) and deep (number of subpages). We have came up with three different sitemap proposals, which can be found in the 'Sitemap & Lo-Fi Diagrams' folder.
