# Team Corellians - IABC Regina Website Redesign Project
####

## Project Background
The IABC Regina branch would like to modernize their website, as it feels outdated and non-intuitive. We see an opportunity to rebuild their website from scratch in WordPress, starting simple and working our way up. This first milestone will involve an affinity diagram, an empathy map, a user story map with future MVPâ€™s, and summary notes from our customer check-in on February 8th.

## Customers
Our North Star customers will be the people interested in the doings (membership, events, careers, etc.) of the IABC Regina branch. Our carry-over customers will be members of other IABC branches.

## Assummptions
We will be using WordPress for our website draft, and we assume to use only free plug-ins, themes and/or features. We also make an assumption to keep the website draft simple and elegant, and start again if we start approaching a complex website (current IABC Regina website).

## Constraints
We cannot employ paid WordPress plugins, themes and features. We cannot use any external software integration (sql, git, kafka, etc.), everything must be localized inside WordPress only.
