## Project Background

The IABC Regina branch would like to modernize their website, as it feels outdated and non-intuitive. We see an opportunity to rebuild their website from scratch in WordPress. This will be accomplished by identifying the requirements of the IABC website as well as recognizing the concerns of the current website.

## Business Need / Opportunity

In this process of redesign, the project calls for improvement in both aspects of aesthetics and functionality. 
Some key aspects of this change include:

+ The website must be easy to navigate for both desktop and mobile users while providing similar functionality and usability.
+ The IABC board members have also identified that they would like to integrate functionality for payment processing internally if possible to make it easier for their customers.
+ It is also essential for the implementation of this website to be easy to maintain but also have the ability to be incrementally improved upon as requirements change.
+ Better link between the Regina chapter page and the International page so there is less duplicated information.  

## Customers

### North Star Customer

Our North Star customers are the members or individuals who are looking to become members of IABC. These members are interested in the events and membership benefits such as the IABC Regina job board.

### Carryover Customers

Our carry-over customers are Companies using the IABC Regina Job Board, the IABC volunteers maintaining the website and potentially members of other IABC branches.

## Assumptions

+ Creating a website using Wordpress which is easy to navigate
+ Utilizing Themes and Colours that represent IABC Regina
+ The website must be simple and elegant
+ Maintaining the website should not require web development experience
+ Previous users should be able to use the website without difficulty
+ Creating a low threshold product with a high ceiling so it can be incrementally updated as requirements change

## Constraints

+ Using Wordpress plugins that are free or within budget
+ The inability to integrate external software with Wordpress
+ Integrating old software with new WordPress features
