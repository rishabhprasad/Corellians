## Activity 4

### Background

For the fourth Milestone, our goal was to transfer our High Fidelity diagrams into a WordPress solution. This involved researching themes, plugins and exploring WordPress's capabilities to bring our vision to life. After this Activity the website is usable by IABC to serve their members. However, the website has the capability to be further improved with additional iterations.

### Customer

We would like to reiterate that our North Star customers are the IABC members.
