## Activity 4

### Background

For the fourth Milestone, our goal was to transfer our High Fidelity diagrams into a WordPress solution. This involved researching themes, plugins and exploring WordPress's capabilities to bring our vision to life. After this Activity the website is usable by IABC to serve their members. However, the website has the capability to be further improved with additional iterations.

### Customer

We would like to reiterate that our North Star customers are the IABC members.

### Website Demo

The website can be downloaded and explored by using the download link above. However, screenshots of the primary pages of the website are included in the `Website Screenshots` directory as well.

## Project Report

The design was a result of work over 4 activities consisting of several meetings with IABC Board members, prototypes and diagrams, as well as research all leading to narrow our solution down to our final design.

## Knowledge Documentation

To manage the knowledge of maintaining the website effectively we have documented the process for things which will be commonly updated or maintained by IABC Volunteers. This is intended for users with any level of WordPress experience and so that the volunteer is able to complete their tasks efficiently.

## Other Relevant Updates

Throughout the Process of this Activity, we separated our work into two activities into two MVPs. The cards in the User Story Map are ordered by MVPs and each card is colour coordinated to indicate whether it is done, in progress, not started, or in testing. + [Click here to view our User Story Map](https://github.com/rishabhprasad/Corellians/blob/main/Milestone%204/User%20Diagrams/User%20Story%20Map%20-%20Corellians.pdf)
