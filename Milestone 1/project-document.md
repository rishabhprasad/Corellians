# Team Corellians - IABC Regina Website Redesign Project
#### By Rishabh Prasad, Matthew Landry, Anupras Burokas

## Project Background
The IABC Regina branch would like to modernize their website, as it feels outdated and non-intuitive. We see an opportunity to rebuild their website from scratch in WordPress. This will be accomplished by identifying the requirements of the the IABC website as well as recognizing the concerns of the current website.

## Business Need / Opportunity
In this process of redesign the project calls for improvement in both aspects of aesthetics and functionality. 
Some key aspects of this change include:
+ The website must be easy to navigate for both desktop and mobile users while providing similar functionality and usability
+ The IABC board members have also identified that they would like to integrate functionality for payment processing internally if possible to make it easier for their customers
+ It is also essential for the implementation of this website to be easy to maintain but also have the ability to be incrementally improved upon as requirements change
+ Better link between the Regina chapter page and the International page so there is less duplicated information.  

## Customers
### North Star Customer
Our North Star customers will be the people interested in the doings (membership, events, careers, etc.) of the IABC Regina branch. 
### Carryover Customers
Our carry-over customers will be members of other IABC branches.

## Assumptions
+ Creating a website using Wordpress which is easy to navigate
+ Utilizing Themes and Colours that represent IABC Regina
+ The website must simple and elegant
+ Maintaing the website should not rely on software experience
+ Previous users should be able to use the website without difficulty
+ Creating a low threshold product with a high ceiling so it can be incremented upon as requirements change

## Constraints
+ Using Wordpress plugins that are free or within budget
+ The inability to integrate external software with Wordpress
+ Integrating old software with new WordPress features
