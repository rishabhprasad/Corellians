## Activity 3

### Background

For the third Milestone, our goal was to bring the structure we created in the Lo-Fi Diagrams to life by adding colour, images, and real information. Our objective for this milestone was to take the structure discussed in previous customer interaction checkpoints and create Hi-Fidelity diagrams. These diagrams display a clear visual of what the website will look and feel like once it is completed.

### Customer

We would like to reiterate that our North Star customers are the IABC members.

### Hi-Fi Diagrams

We created and linked a set of Desktop and Mobile view Hi-Fi prototypes for the board at IABC to visualize if our vision aligned with theirs. These diagrams included relevant images, colour, text and animations to provide them with a complete experience of using the new design of the website. This allows them to provide us with guidance and information on whether the design matches their expectations, and provide us with notes on changes that can be made to make the user's experience more delightful.

+ The new Hi-Fi design we presented was developed based on the second sitemap we proposed in the second milestone presentation. Some updates were made to that sitemap upon their request. This sitemap displays how the navigation across the website is structured.

+ These Hi-Fi diagrams were created with topics discussed in the course `ENSE 271` in mind. This allowed the experience of the design to be intuitive to the user and assured delightfulness.
